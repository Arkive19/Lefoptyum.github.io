            <div class="yap">Hi! I'm <span class="grad">Lefoptyum,</span>a skilled Roblox Builder with over three years of 3D modeling experience. I joined Roblox in 2019 and started building in 2020. After two years of learning, I moved into high-poly CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) builds, which are now my specialty. I've worked on a variety of exciting projects that helped me grow as a designer and collaborator. I enjoy sharing both my work and the creative process behind it. Every model in my portfolio was made for commissions, often within tight deadlines. With more time and freedom, I know the quality could be taken even further—something I’m excited to show in future projects.</div>
